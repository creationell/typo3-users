# TYPO3 users

Users will bring you all essential plugins to build a community with your TYPO3 system. Based on easy to customize fluid templates. The extension will be available for TYPO3 9 as soon as the development is finished.

* Based on bootstrap 4
* Easy to customize (Fluid)
* Easy to install (just put the plugins on the pages and configure directly in the plugin)
* No typoscript configuation needed

## Why only for TYPO3 8?

I develop this extension in an 8 environment on https://filmmusic.io and will make it compatible to 9 after that.
